### Documentation

#### `ExampleStruct`

Adding documentation in a easy step. Start with three slashes
and follow it with a type. This will be the documentation when you
press "Quick Help" in XCode or "Help" in Swift Playgrounds after
you select the name of the struct, enum, class, or actor.

##### `helloWorld`

You can even include documentation for
properties, methods, or initializers.
Follow the same steps and -- BAM! --
you're done.

##### `unpredictableReturnHelloWorld`

You can use ***special*** (yes, Markdown is supported) list items that are used to document functions.

###### Throws
`ExampleEnumConformingToProtocol.exampleCase` approximately half of the time.

#### `ExampleEnumConformingToProtocol`

You can also use multiline comments, if you prefer. Begin with a slash, and **two** `*`s, and
then end how you would with a normal multiline comment. You don't have to add documentation.
This can be good for properties you don't want documentation for.
